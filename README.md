## Types of Learning
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning
4. Inductive Learning
5. **Ensemble Learning**
        
        Each of the learning techniques yeilds a different hypothesis and based on which it makes predictions . 
        In Ensemble learning we combine several hypothesis/models to get a better hypothesis/model . 
        
        Now the question is How to achieve this Ensembling ? 
        
        solution 1 : By Majority voting (Averaging Method)
                     Ex. Random forest , ...
        
        solution 2 : By Weighted Majority voting (Boosting Methods)
                     Ex. Adaboost , Xgboot , ...
                     

In this Section I am going to implement Xgboost for classification on [iris dataset](https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjjz6n85srWAhVMMI8KHQPCBEYQFgg7MAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Farchive.ics.uci.edu%2Fml%2Fdatasets%2Firis&usg=AOvVaw1Ie2tJtamjr-32V6ugIcGU)
